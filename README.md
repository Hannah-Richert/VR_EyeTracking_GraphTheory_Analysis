# Bsc-Thesis Repository: Graph Analysis on Eye-Tracking Data

This is a repository belonging to a Bsc-Thesis at the Neurobiopsychology Group at the University of Osnabr√ºck with the title:
"Exploratory Analysis of Visual Behavior During Free Exploration of a Large-Scale VR Environment Using a Graph-Theoretical Framework to Identify Characteristics and Differences in Spatial Exploration"

This readme will provide rough documentation about the files' structure and purpose, with further documentation at the beginning of the files themselves.

## 0. Data Origin

The raw Eye-tracking data stems from an experiment by Schmidt et al. (2022):
It was further processed by a pipeline by Jasmin Walter: Github:

The resulting data are "gazes" of participants, saved in Matlab format.

### 1.1 .mat to csv. conversion
The first instance we want to switch to python. 
Therefore the '.mat' files are converted into '.csv' files

## 2. Data Analysis
